REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
	Searching is always done via regular expressions. The
	particular kind of expressions used are based on the
	POSIX Basic Regular Expressions (4th Edition of the
	Single Unix Specification). Some additions from the
	Extended Regular Expression and PERL were added and
	some features of the POSIX specification are missing as
	noted below.
	
	ABSENT FEATURES
		Equivalence classes
		Coallating classes
		Character classes
	
	ESCAPES
		Escape sequences are not defined by in BREs.
		This is an extension based on ISO C's. Further,
		they are allowed in bracketed expressions (but
		not in ranges).
		
		\t	tab
		\n	linefeed
		\r	carriage return
		\\	backslash
		\f	form feed
		\v	vertical tab
	
	ANCHORS
		^ and $ always act as anchors and never as
		ordary characters except in bracketed
		expressions. (BRE allows this).
	
	EXTENDED OPERATORS
		These operators were taken from the Extended
		Regular Expression specification.
	  	
		+	one or more repetitions
		?	zero or one repetitions
	
	PERL-STYLE CLASSES
		
		\a	lowercase letter
		\A	uppercase letter
		\b	word boundary anchor [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
		\B	word boundary anchor [a-zA-Z0-9_]
		\d	digit
		\D	non-digit
		\s	space
		\S	non-space
		\w	word character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
		\W	non-word character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
		\<	beginning of word anchor
		\>	end of word anchor
